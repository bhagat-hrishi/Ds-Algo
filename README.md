# Data Structure and Algorihtms


# Heap
- To identify heap question 
    - K is given 
    - to find smallest or largest
        - if smallest make min heap
        - if largest make max heap
- STL 
    - max heap 
    > `priority_queue <int> max_heap`

    - min heap 
    > `priority_queue< int,vector<int>,greater<int> >min_heap`

- Note 
    - for every heap questions first discuss sorting approach



# Sliding window
- To identify sliding window question
    - given array or string and question ask about some subarry or substring and also about some largetst or min and k(window size) is given 
- Types of sliding window
    - Fixed size window
        - window size is fixed and asked some info on windows(like max sum or min sum etc.)
        - Easy problem
    - Variable size window
        - window size **not** given , window size may be  asked or  some sum or max , min is given 
        - Comparatively hard some times need to use map and list 
- note 
    - sliding window is always continous


# Binary Search 
- Time complexity - O(log(n))
- Whenever there is **sorted** keyword thing once to apply Binary Search
