# Data Structure and Algorihtms
## Time complexity
- Time taken by algo as function of length of i/p 



## Sliding window
- To identify sliding window question
    - given array or string and question ask about some subarry or substring and also about some largetst or min and k(window size) is given 
- Types of sliding window
    - Fixed size window
        - window size is fixed and asked some info on windows(like max sum or min sum etc.)
        - Easy problem
    - Variable size window
        - window size **not** given , window size may be  asked or  some sum or max , min is given 
        - Comparatively hard some times need to use map and list 
- note 
    - sliding window is always continous


## Binary Search 
- Time complexity - O(log(n))
- Whenever there is **sorted** keyword thing once to apply Binary Search


## Stack 
- Identification 
    - if array is presnet may be stack or heap (may be u want to sort for heap)
    -
