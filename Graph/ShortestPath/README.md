# Shortest Path

- Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm [Shortest Path in weight Directed Graph]
    - It uses `greedy method:` Always pick the next closest vertex to the source.
    - It `uses priority queue` to store unvisited vertices by distance from s.
    - **It does not work with negative weights.**

- Bellman Ford [Shortest path in weighted graph `with negative edges`]
    - **This algo will not work if there is negative edge cycle** 

- Application 
    - Finding fastest way to go from one place to another
    - Finding cheapest way to fly/send data from one city to another
